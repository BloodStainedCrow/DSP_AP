# Dyson Sphere Program Archipelago Mod

This mod was based on the [Archipelago BepInEx Template](https://github.com/alwaysintreble/ArchipelagoBepInExPluginTemplate). 

This project contains a BepInEx mod for Dyson Sphere Program that enables Archipelago multiworld support.
It is currently in alpha, so if you encounter any bugs, or anything else noteworthy, please report it in the [DSP thread in the Archipelago Discord](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1209684747694121002).
Please include the mod version you are using, and the version of DSP. (Both can be seen in the main menu, in the top left and bottom left corner respectively)

The corresponding apworld can be found [here](https://github.com/BloodStainedCrow/Archipelago-DSP/releases).
Note the the major version must match between the mod and the apworld! (i.e. x.y.1 of the mod and x.y.4 of the apworld. the x and y must be the same!)

To install this mod, see the instructions in the corresponding setup guide, which is available [here](https://github.com/BloodStainedCrow/Archipelago-DSP/blob/main/worlds/dsp/docs/setup_en.md).
For general information about the Dyson Sphere Program multiworld, see the corresponding documentation, which is available [here](https://github.com/BloodStainedCrow/Archipelago-DSP/blob/main/worlds/dsp/docs/en_Dyson%20Sphere%20Program.md).
